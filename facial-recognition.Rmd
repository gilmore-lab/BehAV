# Coding [Facial Recognition](facial-recognition.Rmd)

Coding will be completed using [Datavyu](http://datavyu.org/)

## MomHead

`<MomHead-m>`

### General Orientation

This code captures the times that the mom head or any part of the head is in the video frame. 
Times when the head is in view are scored as events, where the gray spaces between cells mean the head is out of view.

Coders are watching/tagging each of these events by marking onset/offset times for the duration of time the mom head is within the viewing frame.

### Value List

`m` = mom head in video

### Operational Definitions

`<m>` Code "m" when any part of the mom head is in the video frame

### How to Code

Quick coding of head in view.

Set “JUMP-BACK-BY” key to 1 s.

Enable cell highlighting on the controller.

Watch in real time for the mom's movement. As soon as you see mom's head in the frame; hit #5-STOP and then hit “JUMP-BACK-BY” to go back to the timestamp that is just before the mom's head appears in the frame. 

Hit ENTER to create a new cell at this Onset.

Now, watch in real time to see when the mom head is out of the frame. 
The Offset is when the mom head is out of the frame least 0.5 s

To set the Offset, use the same rules for mechanics as with the Onset. 
Hit #5-STOP and then hit “JUMP-BACK-BY” to go back to the timestamp that is just before the head exits the frame. 
Then JOG forward by hitting #3-JOGFORWARD until you reach the Offset of that cell. 
If you go too far, you can JOG backward by hitting #1-JOGBACK. 
You will likely have to hit the JOG keys numerous times. 
If you feel that you have either jumped too far back or went too far forward, hold the JOG keys to move in either direction a bit faster.

Hit #9-SET-OFFSET to create the Offset

### Create MomFeature column

In the spreadsheet window

- select spreadsheet > temporal alignment (Command + t)
- select the first block in the MomHead column

In the Data Viewer Controller  

- select snap region  
  - this will allow you to code in the MomFeature column just during the MomHead sections  

In the spreadsheet window  

For the first cell in the column  

- Highlight the 'MomFeature' heading   
- create a new cell by pressing 'Enter' on the number pad  

Contine the above process until the 'Snap Region' section has been coded.

## BabyHead

`<BabyHead-b>`

### General Orientation

This code captures the times that the baby head or any part of the head is in the video frame. 

Times when the head is in view are scored as events, where the gray spaces between cells mean the head is out of view.

Coders are watching/tagging each of these events by marking onset/offset times for the duration of time the mom head is within the viewing frame.

### Value List

`b` = baby head in video

### Operational Definitions

`<b>` Code "b" when any part of the baby head is in the video frame

### How to Code

Quick coding of head in view.

Set “JUMP-BACK-BY” key to 1 s.

Enable cell highlighting on the controller.

Watch in real time for the baby's movement. As soon as you see baby's head in the frame; hit #5-STOP and then hit “JUMP-BACK-BY” to go back to the timestamp that is just before the baby's head appears in the frame. 

Hit ENTER to create a new cell at this Onset.

Now, watch in real time to see when the baby head is out of the frame. 
The Offset is when the baby head is out of the frame least 0.5 s

To set the Offset, use the same rules for mechanics as with the Onset. 
Hit #5-STOP and then hit “JUMP-BACK-BY” to go back to the timestamp that is just before the head exits the frame. 
Then JOG forward by hitting #3-JOGFORWARD until you reach the Offset of that cell. 
If you go too far, you can JOG backward by hitting #1-JOGBACK. 
You will likely have to hit the JOG keys numerous times. 
If you feel that you have either jumped too far back or went too far forward, hold the JOG keys to move in either direction a bit faster.

Hit #9-SET-OFFSET to create the Offset  

### Create BabyFeature column

In the spreadsheet window  

- select spreadsheet > temporal alignment (Command + t)
- select the first block in the BabyHead column

In the Data Viewer Controller  

- select snap region
  - this will allow you to code in the BabyFeature column just during the BabyHead sections

In the spreadsheet window  

- For the first cell in the column  

  - Highlight the 'BabyFeature' heading  
  - create a new cell by pressing 'Enter' on the number pad  

Contine the above process until the 'Snap Region' section has been coded.

## MomFeature

`MomFeature(<LE10>,<RE10>,<N10>,<M10>)`

### General Orientation

This code captures the facial features that are in view Eyes (left/right), Nose, Mouth. This includes partial features.

Coders are tagging each of these events for each frame of video.

### Value List
Facial Features  

`<LE10>` Left Eye - from coder perspective  
`<RE10>` Right Eye - from coder perspective  
`<N10>`  Nose  
`<M10>`  Mouth  

### Operational Definitions  

`1` yes  Feature is in frame  
`0` no   Feature is NOT in frame  

### How to Code

- code for `<LE10>`,`<RE10>`,`<N10>`,`<M10>`
  - enter value (1/0), tab repeat 4x
- press #3 to jog one frame
- press #0 to create new cell/set previous offset

## BabyFeature

`BabyFeature(<LE10>,<RE10>,<N10>,<M10>)`

### General Orientation

This code captures the facial features that are in view Eyes (left/right), Nose, Mouth. This includes partial features.

Coders are tagging each of these events for each frame of video.

### Value List
Facial Features  

`<LE10>` Left Eye - from coder perspective  
`<RE10>` Right Eye - from coder perspective  
`<N10>`  Nose  
`<M10>`  Mouth  

### Operational Definitions  

`1` yes  Feature is in frame  
`0` no   Feature is NOT in frame 

### How to Code

- code for `<LE10>`,`<RE10>`,`<N10>`,`<M10>`
  - enter value (1/0), tab repeat 4x
- press #3 to jog one frame
- press #0 to create new cell/set previous offset
