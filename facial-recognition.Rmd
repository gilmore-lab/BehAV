# Coding [Facial Recognition](facial-recognition.Rmd)

# Use this as a template to create BehAV coding paramaters 
# Coding will be completed using [Datavyu](http://datavyu.org/)

## `mom_head`

`<loc_l-f-h-c>`

### General Orientation

This code captures the times that the baby is engaged in self-generated locomotion in any form (i.e., bum shuffling, scooting, belly crawling, hands-knees crawling, cruising, supported walking, independent walking, etc.). 
Also included in this pass are the times when locomotion cannot occur because the baby is held,  and the times baby is constrained in baby furniture (e.g., a belted chair, highchair, or stroller).
Coders score only instances of baby-generated locomotion, and instances of falling, being held, or being constrained. 
Coders do not score instances where baby is stationary but could have locomoted. 
Bouts of locomotion are scored as events, where the gray spaces between cells mean the baby is stationary but not held and not constrained.

Coders are watching/tagging the duration of each of these events (locomotion, falls, held, constrained) by marking onset/offset times. 
To determine locomotion, coders are watching for steps with the feet, the knees, or the bum. 
Any other movements that are not initiated from these three body locations are considered to be a transition between postures and are subsumed by stationary, because it is not locomotion.

### Value List

`f` = front

`s` = side profile

`o` = oblique

`u` = up

`d` = down

`b` = back


### Operational Definitions

`<f>`
Code “f” when mom or baby has 2 eyes, nose, mouth in view

`<s>`Code 's' of the mom or baby shows one eye, profile of nose, one ear. 1 hemisphere of head. 

`<o>` one ear, one full eye, one partial eye (this is between side view and front view ~3/4 face

'<u>` jaw line, underneath of nose 

`<d>` forehead, hairline, eyebrows, bridge of nose, Maybe not whole nose

`<b>` no facial features (eye, nose, lip) maybe ear only


### How to Code

Set “JUMP-BACK-BY” key to 1 s.

Enable cell highlighting.

Watch in real time for the baby's movement.

Watch baby's feet and knees.

As soon as you see baby's foot/knee lift up off of the ground; hit #5-STOP and then hit “JUMP-BACK-BY” to go back to the timestamp that is just before the lift. 
Then JOG forward by hitting #3-JOGFORWARD until you reach the Onset of that cell. 
If you go too far, you can JOG backward by hitting #1-JOGBACK. You will likely have to hit the JOG keys numerous times. 
If you feel that you have either jumped too far back or went too far forward, hold the JOG keys to move in either direction a bit faster. Hit ENTER to create a new cell at this Onset.

Now, watch in real time to see when the baby stops moving. 
The Offset is when the baby stops moving for at least 0.5 s (the pause has to look and feel like an actual pause when you are watching in real time; don't simply end a bout of locomotion because there was a 0.5-s pause, especially if it looks like the baby is about to take another step). 
The first frame when the foot/knee stops moving or when the foot settles into its final position (sometimes infants stop their walking bout on their tip-toes) is the offset. 
The same applies to sliding steps.

To set the Offset, use the same rules for mechanics as with the onset. Hit #5-STOP and then hit “JUMP-BACK-BY” to go back to the timestamp that is just before the lift. 
Then JOG forward by hitting #3-JOGFORWARD until you reach the Offset of that cell. 
If you go to far, you can JOG backward by hitting #1-JOGBACK. You will likely have to hit the JOG keys numerous times. 
If you feel that you have either jumped too far back or went too far forward, hold the JOG buttons to move in either direction a bit faster.

## `momloc`

`<loc_l-f>`

### General Orientation

This code captures the times that mom is engaged in locomotion or fell.

Bouts of locomotion are scored as events, where the gray spaces between cells mean the mom is stationary.

Coders are watching/tagging each of these events by marking onset/offset times for the duration of locomotion bouts

Coders are watching for steps with the feet, the knees, or the bum.
Any other movements that are not initiated from these three body locations is considered to be a transition between postures and is subsumed by stationary, as it is not locomotion.

Bouts that are coded as “.” means that mom is off camera or her legs are off camera, and coder cannot see or infer whether mom is stationary or moving.

### Value List

`l` = locomotion

`f` = fall

`.` = when mother is off camera and coder cannot determine whether mom is moving or stationary

### Operational Definitions

`<l>`
Code 'l' when the mom is engaged in locomotion of any form (i.e., walking, scooting, knee-walking, crawling). 

If you're not sure whether the mom is moving or stationary (e.g., occlusion behind furniture or unclear video footage), then this is missing data and the offset of the locomotion bout should be set to the last frame where you can see mom.

The subsequent cell (where you cannot see anything or make an inference about movement) should be coded as “.” until you can see mom again.

However, if you can infer that mom is moving or stationary (i.e., head is bobbing, shadow of the leg moving is visible, etc.) then include it in the same bout of locomotion, following the rules for pauses above.

`<f>`

Code 'f' if the mom loses control over her body (i.e., balance) and cannot recover on her own before the body (bum, hands, torso) hits the ground. 

All falls count. They can happen while upright, on/off furniture or other elevation, while sitting, or while engaged in locomotion.

From an upright or squatting position: a loss of balance results in the hands, knees, or a toy in the hands hitting the ground.

### How to Code

Set “JUMP-BACK-BY” key to 1 s.

Enable cell highlighting on the controller.

Watch in real time for the mom's movement.

Watch for the feet and knees.

As soon as you see mom's foot/knee lift up off of the ground; hit #5-STOP and then hit “JUMP-BACK-BY” to go back to the timestamp that is just before the lift. 
Then JOG forward by hitting #3-JOGFORWARD until you reach the onset of that cell. If you go too far, you can JOG backward by hitting #1-JOGBACK. 
If you feel that you have either jumped too far back or went too far forward, hold the JOG keys to move in either direction a bit faster. 
Hit ENTER to create a new cell at this Onset.

Now, watch in real time to see when the mom stops moving. 
The Offset is when the mom stops moving for at least 0.5 s (the pause has to look and feel like an actual pause when you are watching in real time; don't simply end a bout of locomotion because there was a 0.5-s pause, especially if it looks like the mom is about to take another step). 
The first frame when the foot/knee stops moving or when the foot settles into its final position is the offset. The same applies to sliding steps.

To set the Offset, use the same rules for mechanics as with the Onset. 
Hit #5-STOP and then hit “JUMP-BACK-BY” to go back to the timestamp that is just before the lift.
